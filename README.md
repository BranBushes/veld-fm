## About

`veld` is a powerful, modern file manager that runs directly in your terminal. Inspired by classic TUIs like Ranger and Midnight Commander, `veld` offers a fresh take with an emphasis on simplicity, ease of use, and multi-panel navigation.

## ‚ú® Features

*   üóÇÔ∏è **Tileable Panels:** Open multiple directory views side-by-side to streamline your workflow.
*   üìÇ **Toggle-able File Previews:** Automatically see a preview of the highlighted file‚Äîtext, code, and even images. Press a key to hide it when you need more space.
*   üîç **Recursive File Search:** Instantly find files and directories within the current panel.
*   ‚å®Ô∏è **Intuitive Navigation:** Navigate your filesystem and switch between panels with familiar, ergonomic keybindings.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Powerful File Operations:** Perform common operations like copy, move, delete, and rename in the active panel.
*   **·ãö Archive Management:** Create and extract zip/tar archives directly within the file manager.
*   üé® **Customizable Keybindings:** Don't like the defaults? Change every keybinding by editing a simple configuration file.
*   üêß **Cross-Platform:** Built with Python and Textual, `veld` runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
*   **Vim Mode:** Queue up file operations and execute them in a batch, Vim-style.

## üöÄ Installation

You need Python 3.9+ and `pip` installed.

Install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BranBushes/veld-fm.git
```

Or using `uv`:
```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/BranBushes/veld-fm.git
```

This will install `veld` and make the `veld` command available in your terminal.

## üíª Usage

Once installed, you can run `veld` from anywhere in your terminal. You can also provide an optional starting directory for the first panel.

```bash
# Start in the default home directory
veld

# Start in the ~/Documents directory
veld ~/Documents
```

### Navigating Panels

Use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to cycle focus between open panels. The active panel is highlighted with a colored border.

### Vim Mode

Veld includes an optional Vim-style command mode for batching file operations.

*   **Enter Command Mode:** Press `:` to open the command input.
*   `:vim` - Toggles Vim Mode on or off.
*   `:w` - Executes (writes) all queued actions.
*   `:c` - Clears all queued actions.

When Vim Mode is active, a list of queued actions will appear in the bottom-right corner.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

Keybindings are organized by function and can be fully customized (see Configuration section).
